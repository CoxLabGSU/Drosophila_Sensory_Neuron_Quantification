# Drosophila_Sensory_Neuron_Quantification

The following FIJI and R codes are for use with thresholded neuronal images. The FIJI macro requires ".jpg" files within the input folder. Note: ".jpeg" files will not work. The FIJI macro processes all images within 1 folder regardless of genotype/condition. The FIJI macro has pop-up windows for further instructions. 

When running the R code, select the same input folder as the one chosed for FIJI macro. The R code will combine and sort all relevant metrics and create graphs for each metric. R output files begin "1_".

For additional help with macros please contact Dr. Atit A. Patel (apatel221@gsu.edu)
